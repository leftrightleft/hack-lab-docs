# Hi!

Welcome to Hack-Lab.  Let's get started!

We're going to put together your Raspberry Pi and get you hacking.  There are a couple things you need to know before we can begin.

## What you'll need

-  Wifi password
-  USB Keyboard
-  USB Mouse
-  HDMI TV or computer monitor
-  Speakers/Headphones (These are only needed if you connect to a display without speakers)

After you find these items (you might need your parents help), click the link below to be taken to the next page.
